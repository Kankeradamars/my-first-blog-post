    <p> Build a youtube home page by HTML and CSS Coding, sometimes called computer programming, 
        is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, 
        and writing code is like creating a set of instructions.
         By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way.
         Computer code is very important. Almost every electronic device you use relies on code.
          The way things work can seem quite confusing, but when you break it down it's actually simple.

         People who make code are called programmers, coders or developers. They all work with computers to create websites, apps, and even games! 
         Today you'll learn what code it, what it is for, and how to start learning code yourself. </p>
